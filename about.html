          <p>
            Laminar Softworks was founded in 2013 by Luke Charles, it has gone through many different iterations and evolutions since it's creation. Laminar was first envisioned as a product design company which would prototype different household products with a Bauhaus design movement theme.
          </br>
            However, Laminar Innovations, which it was previously referred to, pivoted to something more appealing to an audience in modern times.
          </br>Laminar Softworks was then created and under the new brand name,
            the company wanted to sell products within the realm of computer science rather than physics or other sciences. This however, is not to say that all previous work has been pointless, it is just to say that all previous work will be taken into account when moving into the future!
          </p>
          <p class="dark">
            Before Laminar Softworks, Laminar Innovations was co-founded by Luke Charles and Joe Ball during their secondary school product design lessons. Some of the products which were made under the Laminar name can be seen below.
            It's important to note that these products are simply prototypes for what could some day, be an actual product which is sold under Laminar Softworks. Obviously, pivoting to software and hardware for computer systems is something which Luke chose to do based upon his aspirations for the company and so making household products under the Laminar trademark is something of a rarity.

              Luke first envisioned the organisation after a game called "Portal" was released. This game included a fictional company by the name of Aperture Science. But this time, there would be less neurotoxin.
